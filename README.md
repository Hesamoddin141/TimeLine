TimeLine Application
TimeLine is a photo organization tool that helps you relive your memories by creating a chronological timeline of your photos. It extracts metadata (e.g., timestamps, locations) and uses face detection to group photos by people, events, or locations. The application allows you to navigate through your photo history in a meaningful way.

Features
Chronological Timeline: Organize photos based on their timestamps.
Face Detection: Detect faces in photos and optionally recognize individuals.
Event Clustering: Group photos into events based on time and location.
Interactive UI: Navigate through your timeline with filters for date, location, and people.
Optional Enhancements:
Emotion analysis to detect moods in photos.
Photo enhancement for old or low-quality images.
Privacy controls to anonymize sensitive metadata.
